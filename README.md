# Smart-room-controller
Full-stack IoT System - Smart Room Controller
Project Overview

This project involves building a Full-stack IoT System using an ESP32 microcontroller, Flask backend, and Flet frontend to create a Smart Room Controller. The system adjusts room lighting and ventilation based on sensor inputs and provides a dashboard for manual override.

Objective:

Develop a dashboard to display sensor data and provide control toggles for outputs.

Implement a backend API using Flask to communicate between ESP32 and frontend.

Utilize GitHub for version control and project submission.

Hardware Components

D1 Mini ESP32 (Microcontroller)

LDR (Analog sensor for light level detection)

PIR Motion Sensor (Digital sensor for presence detection)

LED Strip (Digital output for room lighting)

Fan (via PWM) (Analog output for air circulation)

Connecting wires and breadboard
